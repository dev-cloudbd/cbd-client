# This file configures the CloudBD disks that will attach to this server.
#
# CloudBD disks attach using the nbd kernel module. Each disk requires an
# 	available nbd device to connect through. The default nbd kernel module
# 	settings create 16 nbd devices available for use named nbd[0-15].
#
# <nbd#>	Available nbd device on this machine
# <remote>	Storage remote name described by a config file at
# 		/etc/cloudbd/remotes.d/<remote>.conf
# <disk>	Name of a disk stored on <remote> created by the cloudbd CLI
#
# Attached CloudBD disks will appear in /dev/mapper/ as a block device named
# 	/dev/mapper/<remote>:<disk>
#
# For more information on attaching disks and disk driver options, see the
#	documentation at https://www.cloudbd.io/docs/introduction.html

# Example Disk Configuration
# <nbd#>   <remote>:<disk>          [driver options]
# nbd0     remote1:example_disk1
# nbd1     remote2:example_disk2    connections=32,block_buffers=24,threads=4
